    "The current infrastructure of IOS XR benefits the demand for network automation of increasingly bigger networks. The infrastructure offers flexibility in the range of management protocols, as well as in encoding formats. The wide featureset of YANG models includes native, OpenConfig and IETF models and allows a programmable interaction with such network devices. Lastly, the decoupling of these three components within the infrastructure show its adaptability to preferences for networking and programming tools.\n",

    "**NETCONF overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "NETCONF is a communication protocol for network management, used over Secure Shell (SSH) transport. Network devices will typically run NETCONF servers and a NETCONF client / application will use Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to retrieve the state of a device or to modify a device's configuration. A NETCONF operation and its payload are encoded in the Extensible Markup Format (XML).\n",
    "\n",
    "IOS XR comes with a NETCONF server that can be activated using the following commands:\n",
    "Â ```\n",
    " netconf-yang agent ssh\n",
    " netconf agent tty\n",
    " \n",
    " ssh server v2\n",
    " ssh server netconf vrf default\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " By default, the server will open port 830 for NETCONF communication.\n",
    " \n",
    " **Configuration datastores in NETCONF**\n",
    " \n",
    " A NETCONF server will have defined one or more configuration datastores available for configuration management. Such a datastore contains configuration needed to transition the device from an initial state to the intended operational state. The `<running>` configuration datastore holds the current active configuration on the device and is present in the base implementation of the protocol. Support for more datastores can be defined by extending the capabilities of a device.\n",
    " \n",
    " In the case of IOS XR, there are two datastores available:\n",
    " - `<running>` - it holds the active configuration of the device\n",
    " - `<candidate>` - it holds configuration that can be changed without affecting the running configuration; the changes can be committed to the running configuration datastore or they can be discarded\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " **Protocol operations in NETCONF**\n",
    " \n",
    "NETCONF supports operations for configuration management and state retrieval. The operations from the base protocol are:\n",
    "- **`get`** - the client requests a copy of the running configuration and of the device's state \n",
    "- **`get-config`** - the client requests a copy of the configuration of a datastore; filters are supported\n",
    "- **`edit-config`** - the client asks the server to apply modifications to the configuration of a target datastore\n",
    "- `copy-config` - the client asks the server to create or overwrite the entire target configuration datastore with the contents of another datastore\n",
    "- `delete-config` - the client asks the server to delete the target configuration datastore\n",
    "- **`lock`** - the client locks a server's target configuration datastore; this is intended for short time periods when changes are being applied and interference with other clients or management entities is unwanted \n",
    "- **`unlock`** - the client releases the lock from a server's target configuration datastore\n",
    "- **`close-session`** - the client gracefully ends its NETCONF session with the server\n",
    "- `kill-session` - the client forcely ends its NETCONF session with the server, aborting ongoing operations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory you will practice the operations highlighted in bold."
